# TASK: Find how many times the word 'and' in in the book 'My Family and other Animals'

1. Write the pseudocode, identify the data, logic and actions
2. Come up with an alternative approach
3. Consider which version is more efficient

## PSEUDO-CODE

Check if you have the book
if no
print a message to let the user know
exit
if yes
open the book
write 0 in a notebook
for every word
check if the word is equal to 'and'
if yes
update the number in the notebook
if no
do nothing
close the book
read the number in the notebook
exit

## Alternative version

I can't really think of an alternative version, I suppose I could start counting from the last page of the book and go backward

## Data, Logic, Actions

1. Data

- book
- word to search ('and')
- number written in the notebook

2. Logic

- Checking if the book is available
- Checking if we reached the last word

3. Actions

- Open the Book
- Compare the current word with 'and'
- Print the message
- Close the Book

## Compare the two versions, which one is more efficient?

- They would be the same
